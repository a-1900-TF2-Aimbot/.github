## 💡 What Is the TF2 Aimbot?

A **TF2 aimbot** is an automated aim enhancer that locks your crosshair directly to enemy hitboxes, adjusts your FOV aiming zone, and either **snaps instantly** or **tracks smoothly** for more legit play. Works on both **casual and community servers**, and pairs perfectly with **ESP**, **triggerbot**, and **recoil remover** for full aim domination.
